# ER Skip Startup Cutscene Skipper

## Description
Simple DLL to replace runtime execution of function body which shows startup cutscenes with an early return.

## Users
1. This DLL requires that you have your own form for injecting the DLL into Elden Ring. Popular solutions include [Lazy Loader](https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/677) for souls games generally and [Mod Loader](https://github.com/techiew/EldenRingModLoader). I suggest using Lazy Loader since this DLL does not require the await that ER ML provides.

1. Injecting this DLL while connected to official FromSoft servers is **NOT RECOMMENDED**.

1. The latest and safe to use DLL will always be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/chozandrias76/er-skip-startup-cutscenes/releases) page, and this page should be linked/back-linked to [my corresponding Nexus Mod author page](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/xenos76/mods).
